## Rare-Variant Association Methods

```{r}

```
##### **Burden tests:**

Strengths – are more powerful when there is a large proportion of variants are casual and effects are in the same direction

Limitations – less powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small proportion of causal variants are often

* **CMC**

(a) Idea: that uses allele frequencies to determine the divisions of the variants into groups. After the rare are selected, they are collapsed into an indicator variable and then a multivariate test is applied to the collection formed by the common variants and the collapsed variant.

(b) Model: For the CMC method, markers are divided into subgroups. (e.g. allele frequencies), and within each group, marker data are collapsed. A multivariate test (e.g. Hotelling’s T2 test) is then applied for analysis of the groups of marker data. 

(c) R function

Multiple-marker test equation:
  
$$
S = \frac{1}{N_A + N_A - 2}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_A}{(x_i - \bar{x})(x_i - \bar{x})^T + \sum_{j = 1}^{N_\bar{A}{(Y_i - \bar{Y})(Y_i - \bar{Y})^T}
$$
Single-marker test equation:

Hotelling's T2 test:

CMC(y, X, maf = 0.05, perm = 100) 

Y: Numeric vector with phenotype status: 0=controls, 1=cases. No missing data allowed.

X: numeric matrix or data frame with genotype data coded as 0, 1, 2. Missing data is allowed. 

##### **Adaptive Burden tests:** 

Strengths – are stronger than burden tests using fixed weights or thresholds. Some tests can improve result interpretation

Limitations – are usually computationally intensive. VT requires the same assumptions as burden tests

* **aSum test** 

(a) Idea: The aSum test is also called an Adaptive sum test and it is the approach behind the adaptive test is to use the U-statistics of the score test in order to construct a statistic with the first components of the score vector U. 

(b) Model: The Sum test can be used to summarize information on multiple Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP’s) with a DF=1. Adaptive Sum tests are low power and have limited control over error type I.

(c) R function

Equation:

ASUM(y, X, perm = 100)

Y: numeric vector with phenotype status: 0=controls, 1=cases. No missing data allowed

X: numeric matrix or data frame with genotype data coded as 0, 1, 2. Missing data is allowed

##### **Variance-Component tests:** 

Strengths – are powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small amount of causal variants

Limitations – are less powerful than burden tests when most variants are causal and effects are in the same direction

* **SKAT** 

(a) Idea: SKAT is a Sequencing Kernal Association Test which can be used to calculate p-values by fitting the null mode containing only the covariates and so it can easily be applied to genome-wide data.

(b) Model: SKAT tests have a relationship between variants and the phenotype by using classical multiple linear and logistic regression.

(c) R function

Equation:

SKAT(y, X, kernel = "linear", weights = NULL, a = 1, b = 25, perm = NULL) 

Y: numeric vector with phenotype status: 0=controls, 1=cases. No missing data allowed

X: numeric matrix or data frame with genotype data coded as 0, 1, 2.

* **C-alpha test** 

(a) Idea: C-alpha tests allow for consistent and/or increased power and straightforward calculations when testing the variance of a set containing both protective and risk variants.

(b) Model:

(c) R function

Binomial distribution equation:

CALPHA(y, X, perm = NULL)

Y: numeric vector with phenotype status: 0=controls, 1=cases. No missing data allowed

X: numeric matrix or data frame with genotype data coded as 0, 1, 2. 

##### **Combined tests:** 

Strengths – are stronger with respect to the percentage of causal variants and the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants.

Limitations – can be slightly less powerful than burden or variance-component tests if their assumptions are largely held; some methods are computationally intensive like the Fisher method

* **SKAT-O** 

(a) Idea: SKAT-O is part of the extended family of SKAT and it is optimal unified test. This test doesn’t need to be resampled when computing asymptotic p values and it is easy to adjust to covariates.

(b) Model:

##### **EC test:** 

Strengths – is powerful when a very small proportion of variants are causal

Limitations – is computationally intensive; is less powerful when a moderate or large proportion of variants are causal

* **EC test**
