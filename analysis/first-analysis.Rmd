## Rare-Variant Association Methods

```{r}

```
Material is from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4085641/ 

What are rare variant association methods discussed in the paper?

Burden tests, Adaptive burden tests, Variance component tests, Combined tests and EC tests

What are their strengths and limitations?

Burden tests: 

Strengths – are more powerful when there is a large proportion of variants are casual and effects are in the same direction

Limitations – less powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small proportion of causal variants are often

Adaptive Burden tests:

Strengths – are stronger than burden tests using fixed weights or thresholds. Some tests can improve result interpretation

Limitations – are usually computationally intensive. VT requires the same assumptions as burden tests

Variance Component tests 

Strengths – are powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small amount of causal variants

Limitations – are less powerful than burden tests when most variants are causal and effects are in the same direction

Combined tests:

Strengths – are stronger with respect to the percentage of causal variants and the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants.

Limitations – can be slightly less powerful than burden or variance-component tests if their assumptions are largely held; some methods are computationally intensive like the Fisher method

EC test: 

Strengths – is powerful when a very small proportion of variants are causal

Limitations – is computationally intensive; is less powerful when a moderate or large proportion of variants are causal
