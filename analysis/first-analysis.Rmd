## Rare-Variant Association Methods

Burden tests: 

Strengths – are more powerful when there is a large proportion of variants are casual and effects are in the same direction

Limitations – less powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small proportion of causal variants are often

CMC method is used to find associations with rare variant for common diseases.

Adaptive Burden tests:

Strengths – are stronger than burden tests using fixed weights or thresholds. Some tests can improve result interpretation

Limitations – are usually computationally intensive. VT requires the same assumptions as burden tests

aSum test is also know as data-adaptive test which is used for disease association with multiple common or rare variants.

Variance-Component tests: 

Strengths – are powerful in the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants or a small amount of causal variants

Limitations – are less powerful than burden tests when most variants are causal and effects are in the same direction

SKAT is a rare-variant association test for sequencing data with the sequence association test.

C-alpha tests are used to detect unusual distribution of rare variants.

Combined tests:

Strengths – are stronger with respect to the percentage of causal variants and the presence of both trait increasing and decreasing variants.

Limitations – can be slightly less powerful than burden or variance-component tests if their assumptions are largely held; some methods are computationally intensive like the Fisher method

SKAT-O are the best tests to find rare variant effects in sequencing association studies.

EC test: 

Strengths – is powerful when a very small proportion of variants are causal

Limitations – is computationally intensive; is less powerful when a moderate or large proportion of variants are causal

EC test is an exponential combination procedure for set-based association tests in sequencing studies.
